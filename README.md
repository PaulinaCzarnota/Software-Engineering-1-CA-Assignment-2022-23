This repository contains my Software Engineering 1 Continuous Assessment assignment, completed in the second year of my Computer Science degree at TU Dublin.

# Project Overview

This project features comprehensive **UML modeling** for a library system, developed using **StarUML**. The assignment includes the following UML diagrams, which collectively represent the system's functionality and structure:

### Diagrams Included
- **Use Case Diagram**: Illustrates the interactions between users and the library system, highlighting key functionalities.
- **Class Diagram**: Represents the system's classes, attributes, methods, and relationships, providing a detailed structure of the system.
- **Activity Diagram**: Depicts the workflows and processes within the library system, showing the sequence of activities.
- **Sequence Diagram**: Details the interactions between objects in the system over time, clarifying the flow of messages.

### Grade Received: 84%

This assignment demonstrates my understanding of UML modeling principles and their application in software engineering. Explore the repository to review the diagrams and gain insights into the design of a library system.
